I am a second-year M.S. student in mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota working with Professor Victor Barocas on the statistical shape modeling of the aorta. I completed my B.S. in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Outside of academics, I enjoy climbing and playing basketball.
