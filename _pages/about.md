I am a second-year M.S. student in mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota working with [Professor Victor Barocas](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/barocas/home) on the statistical shape modeling of the aorta. I completed my B.S. in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute where I was awarded the [Salisbury Prize](https://www.wpi.edu/about/awards/salisbury-prize).

Outside of academics, I enjoy climbing and playing basketball.
